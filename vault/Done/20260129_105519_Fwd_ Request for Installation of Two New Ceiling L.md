Respected Sir,



I hope this message finds you well.I respectfully request the installation

of two new ceiling lights in Office #216, New Block, adjacent to the

Quaid-e-Azam Library. I would like to mention that this request has been

submitted verbally since November 2024, but the lighting issue still

persists.



At present, the lighting condition in the office is insufficient.The

installation of additional ceiling lights will significantly improve

visibility.



I shall be very grateful for your kind consideration and approval of this

request at your earliest convenience.



Thanking you in anticipation.



Yours sincerely,

Iram Shahzadi

Department of IT
