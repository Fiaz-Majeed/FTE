**Response to CMS Access Request**

Dear Erum Rizvi,

Thank you for your request for extended access to the Course Management System for uploading student marks.

I understand that you need access beyond the current 12 o'clock deadline to complete your task. I will coordinate with the Software Development & Maintenance Center (SDMC) to extend your access privileges as needed.

I will contact you directly once the access has been granted or if any additional information is required from your end.

Best regards,

Dr. Fiaz Majeed
Chairperson, Department of Information Technology
